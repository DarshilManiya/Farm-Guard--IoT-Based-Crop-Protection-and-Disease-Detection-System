Farm Guard: IoT Based Crop Protection and Disease Detection System

Project Description

Overview:
Agriculture, as the backbone of our economy, faces persistent challenges such as animal intrusions and crop diseases, which significantly impact crop yields and economic stability. To address these challenges, the Farm Guard project introduces an innovative solution leveraging IoT technologies for real-time detection and proactive disease management.

End Users:

Farmers
Agricultural Practitioners
Wow Factors:

Integrated IoT Technologies
Real-Time Animal Intrusion Detection
Cloud-Based Image Storage
Practical Integration into Agricultural Practices
User-Friendly Disease Management Application
Prediction of over 40 Leaf Diseases
Problem Statement:
Animal intrusions and crop diseases pose significant threats to global agriculture, leading to substantial economic losses. On average, 30-40% of crops are destroyed annually due to animal intrusion. To combat this issue, the Farm Guard project proposes an IoT-based solution utilizing ESP32-CAM, PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and deterrent measures such as sprinklers or LED strips. The system detects animal presence through PIR sensors, captures images using ESP32-CAM, and uploads them to Firebase for real-time viewing through our application. Simultaneously, deterrent measures are activated to minimize crop destruction. Additionally, the solution provides farmers with an intuitive python application for effective crop disease identification and management.

Technology Stack:

ESP32-CAM
MB Board
PIR Sensor
Ultrasonic Sensor
Sprinkler
LED Strip
Python (Kivy Framework)
Machine Learning
Firebase
Methodology:
The Smart Farm Guard system utilizes ESP32-CAM, PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and Firebase for image storage. Upon detecting animal presence, the system captures images and triggers deterrent measures. The Python application employs image recognition algorithms for disease identification, offering detailed information and treatment recommendations to farmers.

System Overview:
The Farm Guard system effectively reduces crop losses by detecting and deterring animal intrusions in real-time, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting sustainable farming practices. With the ability to predict over 40 diseases, the system offers comprehensive crop protection while potentially saving costs for farmers.

Results:

Reduction in Crop Losses
Increased Agricultural Productivity
Sustainable Agriculture Practices
Comprehensive Disease Prediction
Cost Savings
Diverse Crop Coverage
Future Perspective:
Future iterations of Farm Guard will focus on precision animal repellence using ultrasonic frequencies, advanced machine learning algorithms, collaborative farming networks, integration of environmental sensors, and global accessibility.

Conclusion:
Farm Guard represents a transformative solution for agriculture, integrating IoT technologies and real-time detection to revolutionize crop protection and disease management. With a commitment to user-friendly design and accessibility, Farm Guard aims to empower farmers of all backgrounds and promote sustainability in agriculture.
