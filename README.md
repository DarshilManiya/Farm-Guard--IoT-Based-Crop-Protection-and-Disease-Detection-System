Project Description
Problem Statement
A significant challenge faced by farmers globally is the rampant damage to crops caused by animals, resulting in substantial economic losses. On average, 30-40% of crops are destroyed annually due to animal intrusion. To address this pressing issue, we propose the development of an IoT-based solution leveraging ESP32-CAM, PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and sprinkler or led strip to prevent crop damage. The system will be designed to detect animal presence through PIR sensors, triggering the ESP32-CAM to capture images of the intruding animals, which will then be uploaded to firebase and through firebase it will show in our application. Simultaneously, deterrent measures such as activating sprinklers or emitting ultrasonic sounds or led glowing will be deployed to scare off the animals, minimizing crop destruction. Additionally, the solution will empower farmers to identify crop diseases effectively through an intuitive python application. Farmers can capture images of their crops using their mobile devices, which will be processed using image recognition algorithms on the application. The application will then provide detailed information on the detected diseases and recommended treatments, enabling farmers to take timely corrective measures to safeguard their crops. By integrating IoT technologies with image processing capabilities, this solution aims to mitigate.

Methodology
The Smart Farm-Guard system incorporates a multi-faceted approach using ESP32-CAM, PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and a cloud-based platform, Firebase, for image storage. The ESP32-CAM captures images triggered by PIR sensors upon detecting animal presence. Simultaneously, deterrent measures like sprinklers and ultrasonic sounds are activated. The intuitive Python application employs image recognition algorithms for disease identification, offering farmers detailed information and treatment recommendations. Continuous learning and improvement are ensured through ongoing updates to machine learning algorithms.

Future Perspective

As we envision the future of Smart-Guard, our commitment to innovation and continuous improvement remains unwavering. In the quest to enhance accuracy and efficacy, our upcoming focus lies in the incorporation of ultrasonic frequencies for animal repellence. By harnessing the power of ultrasonic technology, we aim to create a more sophisticated and precise deterrent mechanism.

1. Precision Animal Repellence:
Future iterations of Smart AgriGuard will explore the integration of ultrasonic frequencies to repel animals with even greater precision. This advancement holds the potential to significantly improve the overall accuracy of our animal intrusion detection and deterrent measures.
2. Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms:
Our journey doesn’t stop with ultrasonics; we plan to refine and expand our machine learning algorithms continually. This involves feeding the system with more data, ensuring it evolves into a dynamic and adaptive tool that can effectively anticipate and respond to emerging agricultural challenges.
3. Collaborative Farming Networks:
Looking ahead, we envision the creation of collaborative farming networks, where data from Farm Guard across various farms can be anonymized and shared. This collaborative approach will not only strengthen the predictive capabilities of our system but also foster a community-driven approach to precision agriculture.
4. Introducing Community for farmers
By this community, farmer can connect with other farmers and try to find solution for plant disease other than application solution. Which helps farmer to improve productivity as well as by this community farmer can aware about different disease and their solutions.
5. Integration of Environmental Sensors:
To bolster the resilience of crops against diseases, our future perspective includes the integration of environmental sensors. These sensors will provide additional data on soil health, weather conditions, and other environmental factors, allowing for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to disease management.
6. Global Accessibility:
We aspire to make Smart AgriGuard globally accessible, tailoring the system to the specific needs and challenges of diverse agricultural landscapes. This includes adapting the technology to various crops, climates, and farming practices, ensuring its effectiveness on a global scale.
